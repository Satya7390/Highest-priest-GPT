## How does it work?

### First User (Responder):

  - When the user clicks Create Random Channel as Responder, they generate a random channel and become the responder.
  - The link generated will automatically assign the next user who joins as the questioner.

### Second User (Questioner):

  - The second user (who joins using the link) is automatically the questioner and can ask questions.

### Message Handling:
